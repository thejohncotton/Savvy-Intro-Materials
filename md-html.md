# Introduction To Markdown and HTML


Building off of our [Introduction to The Command Line and git](https://github.com/thejohncotton/Savvy-Intro-Materials) tutorial we now begin to take a look at how to format text content for the web.

### Housekeeping

This is not a course for experienced developers as much as it is a collection of exercises to introduce serious learners to key concepts.

## Install Fest
We'll need the following for today's workshop:

 - A modern Text Editor

 Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the installation instructions.

Once installed click the extensions tab and search for `markdown preview`
Install a markdown preview extension (i.e. Markdown Preview Enhanced) and you are good to go.

## Plain Text
Create a new folder named `html-workshop` somewhere easy to remember. (bonus points if you can do it from the CLI)

Create a file named 'about.txt' and open it in VS Code.

Write a two paragraph bio for yourself (the bar is really low here, don't over think it).
```
Born in ATL, I was raised with my sisters and cat.
I later decided to move to CHA. I play electronic music and am a big fan of synthesizers.
I have two dogs.

Lately I have been really liking functional programming.
I like to keep things brief.
Here is an extra sentence.
```



# HTML
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating webpages and internet applications.
It makes use of tags denoted by `<>` such as `<a>` and `</a>` that wrap the text content and provide context to the broswer.

Syntax: ```<h1>This is a Heading</h1>```

Let's take a look at some more HTML syntax.

# Markdown
Markdown is similar to HTML but it doesn't use tags.


HTML is the standard for web content.
Markdown is the standard for Readme files on github and technical documentation (in fact this tutorial was written in markdown).

Syntax: `# This is a heading` as opposed to `<h1>This is a heading</h1>` in HTML

Let's take a look at some more markdown syntax.

# Challenge Project

Use the bio you wrote at the beginning to create an 'about me' page in markdown, then do the same in HTML.

*Hint:* do this in the `html-workshop` folder.
+ Name the markdown file `README.md`
+ Name the HTML file `index.html`

Try some shortcuts for HTML syntax in VS Code. i.e. `! + tab`


## Deploy your website
We'll be following the [deploy steps](https://github.com/thejohncotton/Savvy-Intro-Materials) from our previous tutorial to get this project on the web!.
